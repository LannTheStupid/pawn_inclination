The Pawn Inclination Calculator is intended to help Dragon's Dogma ((C) CapCom) players.

It calculates answers that has to be answered when a hero meets his/her pawn for the first time. Pawn's A.I. depends on pawn's inclination. The first inclination has the highest priority, then the second, and the third.

For details please check Draron's Dogma wikipedia: [Pawn Inclination](http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/Pawn_Inclination)
 
The command line accepts up to 3 desired inclination in order of importance. If a combination of answers that provides the requested set exists then it is printed to stdout.
